We may also need to contact you about your request, and you can choose the contact method you would like us to use.\n\n \n\nPlease be aware there might be circumstances where we will not take the action you requested. For example, if we’re unable to verify your identity and confirm that you are a California resident, we may deny your access or deletion request, as permitted by the CCPA. In addition, we may fully or partially deny your deletion request if CCPA-recognized exceptions or exemptions apply. Please see our Privacy Policy for more information.\n\n \n\nIf you want an authorized agent to submit a CCPA request on your behalf, the authorized agent must provide proof of your written permission to submit the request(s) on your behalf and other information relating to their authorized agent status.

The power train control module (PCM) computer adjusts the air/fuel mixture to provide the best combination of performance and fuel efficiency\nA higher percentage of fuel to air is described as a rich mixture, while a lower percentage of fuel to air is termed a lean mixture\nOn Ford vehicles, the air/fuel mixture is measured by an electronic sensor that provides input to the power train control module systems\n\nAirbag\n\nDuring a moderate-to-severe frontal impact, the airbag is designed to inflate in approximately 1/20th of a second (less time than it takes to blink an eye) and begins to deflate immediately thereafter. In that brief period, the airbag can help reduce the risk of injury to the head and chest of the driver and/or the right front seat passenger\nElectronic diagnostic module continuously monitors the airbag for proper operation\nWhen the ignition switch is turned to the ON position, the airbag indicator light on the instrument cluster illuminates for approximately six seconds to signal that the system is functioning properly. Should a fault occur in the system, the airbag indicator light flashes, stays on or fails to illuminate when the ignition switch is turned to the Start position. This signifies immediate service is required\nAlways put small children and child seats in the rear seating positions (except jump seats). Deactivate the passenger airbag with the airbag shutoff switch (if equipped) when using a rear-facing child safety seat in the front passenger seat\nDual-stage Airbags\nCan deploy at two different levels, or nor at all, depending on the information sent to the Restraint Control Module from various sensors located within the vehicle\nIn less severe collision events, the airbags will deploy in the lower or first stage of deployment force\nIn more severe collision events, airbags will deploy at both stages or at full force\nSeat sensors, in some front passenger seats, can detect the weight of passengers and deploy only if the occupant is above a certain weightSecond Generation Airbags\nDesigned to inflate with less force than that employed in earlier or first generation designs\nThe airbags reduce the peak inflation pressure and/or rise rate\nRise rate is the force and speed with which an airbag inflates and is controlled by factors such as the type and amount of inflator gas, the actual airbag size and the design of the vent used to release the pressure from the airbag once deployed\nNote: The airbag is not a substitute for safety belts. Safety belts must be properly worn at all times to maximize the effectiveness of the system. Always secure children in the back seat (except jump seats).\n\nAll-Wheel Drive (AWD)\n\nContinuously monitors wheel speed, throttle position and steering-wheel angle sensors to determine the vehicle’s conditions and driver’s intent. The system then determines the optimal amount of front and rear torque for the given conditions to not only reduce wheel slip but to prevent the slip from occurring in the first place\nHelps ensure the vehicle will be sure-footed on the road in a variety of conditions, such as fast cornering, uneven pavement, potholes, slippery surfaces and anything that compromises traction\nVehicle normally functions in front-wheel-drive mode\nWhen sensors detect that wheel slip is occurring or even just likely to occur, the All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) system can react within as little as 50 milliseconds to distribute up to 100 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels\nController may detect a difference in wheel speed front-to-rear even in good weather, such as when driving through sand, mud or wet leaves\nHow the System Works\nAll-Wheel Drive uses electromagnetic activation of an internal clutch pack\nEngages when sensors detect wheel slip in the front wheels, and often acts preemptively to prevent slip from happening in the first place\nWhen activated, the system uses force from an electromagnet to push clutch plates together\nDrive shaft torque is transmitted through the unit to the rear wheels, taking power from the front wheel sand sending it to the rear\nBenefits of the System\nNo driver interaction is required to activate AWD. It’s there when your customers need it\nThe system can send up to 100 percent of the engine’s torque to front or rear as needed to avoid wheel slip\nOperates with speed and sophistication to help provide peace of mind and driving confidence\nReleases just as quickly, avoiding binding or wheel skid once traction improves\nBenefits on either wet or dry pavement. Because the system can transfer torque quickly away from the front wheels, it helps reduce the type of understeer often associated with front-wheel-drive vehicles to provide improved vehicle control\nLightweight with few moving parts, for little impact on fuel economy\nWhen AWD is combined with All-Speed Traction Control or the AdvanceTrac® system, a high degree of torque can be sent to the wheel with the best traction, even if the other three wheels have no traction at all\n\nAlternative Fuel Vehicle (also see E85 Vehicles and Flexible Fuel Vehicle {FFV})\n\nRefers to any type of vehicle that uses nontraditional fuel or power sources:\nMethanol/Ethanol\nCompressed Natural Gas (CNG)\nPropane\nElectricity (as in Escape Hybrid)\n\nAlternator\n\nEngine-driven device that converts mechanical energy into alternating electrical current\nProvides power to run all of the vehicle’s electrical components when the engine is running\nSingle or dual heavy-duty alternators that provide additional charging capacity are also available for applications such as cold-climate operation (temperatures below -20°F) where battery drain and accessory use are typically very high, and vehicles are equipped for towing purposes\n\nAlternator Capacity\n\nTo determine minimum capacity for an alternator:\nMinimum alternator output = Total load x 1.20, where total load comprises continuous night-winter load\nAdd 20 percent (.20) to accommodate anticipated intermittent load\nIn most cases, a 2.51:1 or better alternator drive ratio will provide a reasonably adequate system output\n\nAmbient Interior Lighting\n\nUtilizes Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights to illuminate the vehicle interior: foot wells, cup holders, and controls, depending upon the vehicle\nOffers the ability to change color to suit your mood. Color selections include aqua, blue, green, purple, red, yellow or white lighting\n\nAnti-theft Systems\n\nPerimeter anti-theft alarm system\nGuards the vehicle's doors, hood and trunk/lift gate. When an unauthorized entry occurs, the system trigger sand will:– Flash the head lamps, parking lamps and theft-indicator lamp on the instrument panel\nSound the horn. Note: It will not be triggered by breaking glass or entry into the vehicle through a window. The perimeter anti-theft alarm system is designed to work with the factory-installed Remote Keyless Entry System.SecuriLock® passive anti-theft ignition system\nUses a sophisticated electronically coded ignition key to start the vehicle. The system is designed to help prevent the engine from being started unless a coded key programmed to the vehicle is used. There is no battery on the key itself; the small amount of energy required to identify the key is supplied by the vehicle\nSecuriLock is designed so that it is not necessary for the driver to follow any procedure to arm the system. It is automatically armed when the key is removed from the ignition and is disarmed when the key is reinserted into the ignition\nSpare keys will be available from dealerships. Customers can program their keys by using each original (2) key in the proper sequence and finally inserting a new key for programming (see Owner's Guide for more details)\nThere are billions of possible codes\n\nAuto lamp System\n\nProvides ambient-light-sensitive automatic on-off control of the exterior lights normally controlled by the head lamp control switch\nComes preprogrammed to keep the lights on for approximately 20 seconds after the ignition switch is turned off\nIf desired, the time delay can be reprogrammed on some vehicles to keep the lights on for up to 3 minutes after the ignition is turned off. See the vehicle Owner’s Guide for more details\n\nAuto lock\n\nAuto lock feature will lock all the doors, lift gate and lift gate window when all doors are closed, the ignition is in the ON position, the vehicle is shifted into any drive gear putting the vehicle in motion\nSee the vehicle Owner’s Guide for vehicle-specific information on the range of functions\n\nAuxiliary Springs\n\nUsed on many light trucks for load stability or to support heavy loads with minimal effect on ride characteristics\nHelp control roll and sway of trucks with high bodies that carry loads that might shift when cornering or operating on high-crowned roads\nUsually used on rear leaf springs, and are mounted to act only after the regular springs are partially deflected under heavy loads\n\nAxle Ratio\n\nThe number of output shaft (on front-wheel-drive vehicles) or drive shaft (on rear-wheel-drive vehicles) revolutions required to rotate the axle one full turn\nFor a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with an axle ratio of 3.55:1, the drive shaft would have to rotate 3.55 times to rotate the rear axle once. This is also known as the Final Drive Ratio\nLower numeric axle ratios tend to be more fuel-efficient. Higher axle ratios deliver added torque for increased power for acceleration and trailer towing\nFront-wheel-drive vehicles employ an Axle Transfer Ratio, essentially a Final Drive Ratio\n\nAxle, 2-speed\n\nType of rear drive axle offering two reduction ratios and a control mechanism for selecting either ratio at the driver’s discretion\n\"Lo\" axle range (the higher numerical ratio) provides maximum pulling power\n\"Hi\" range (the lower numerical ratio) provides maximum road speed\n2-speed rear axle permits split-shifting in the lower transmission gears to obtain evenly spaced gear steps that optimize available engine power\n2-speed axle can be used in Lo range for crisp performance at slower speeds or in Hi range for maximum economy on the highway\n\nAxles, Rear Drive\n\nFull-floating Rear Axle — Generally used in heavier-duty applications. The full-floating axle shafts “float” within the outer axle housing where they drive the wheels. The outer housing supports the entire rear weight through double-opposed wheel bearings, which absorb all load and wheel stress\nSemi-floating Rear Axle — The axle shafts and wheel bearings not only support the total weight, but also transmit driving torque to the wheels. This axle system also resists stress due to skidding, turning corners and other traction forces\nSee Live Axle for more information\nDISCLOSURES\nNote.\n\nInformation is provided on an \"as is\" basis and could include technical, typographical or other errors.

We collect and use this data to help fulfill and build on Henry Ford’s vision of providing affordable, safe transportation to everyone. Today, we rely on data to incorporate state-of-the-art technology into our products and services, improve quality and safety, minimize environmental impact, and make our vehicles more enjoyable to drive, own, and use.\n\n \n\nThis Privacy Policy explains our collection, use, and sharing of personal information, including information we collect through our Products (defined below), at offline locations and events, and from third parties.\n\n \n\nIf you are the owner or driver of a Ford or Lincoln vehicle and use Connected Services (defined below), you have some important responsibilities:\n\n \n\n First, it is your responsibility to inform others who drive the vehicle, and passengers who connect their mobile devices to the vehicle, about the information in this Policy, including the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below. \nSecond, if you plan to sell or transfer your vehicle, it is your responsibility to perform a Master/User Reset of your vehicle before it leaves your possession. Please review the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below for more information.\n\n \n\nBy using Products that display, link to, or refer to this Privacy Policy, you acknowledge the disclosures and obligations in this Policy.\n\n \n\nWhat This Privacy Policy Covers\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers and applies to:\n\nPersonal information collected by or on behalf of Ford Motor Company and our controlled affiliates and subsidiaries (“Ford” or “our”) through Products (defined below) that link to, refer to, or display this Privacy Policy (for example, on their websites or in their own privacy policies).\nThe following Connected Services (defined in the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below), which have a Product-specific privacy policy that supplements this Policy:\nFord Pass\nLincoln Way\n\n \n\nAdditional privacy details may be provided in your vehicle owner’s manual.

Ford’s privacy practices (as described in our privacy policies) apply to personal information the dealer shares with us, whether in connection with the purchase/lease transaction, vehicle service you may receive from the dealer, or joint marketing activities.\n\n\nPlease be aware, however, that dealers are separate legal entities from Ford and have their own privacy practices. You should contact your dealer directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. Although we encourage dealers to fully satisfy their legal obligations (including those relating to privacy), Ford is not responsible for dealers’ compliance with law.\n\n \n\nUnited States Only\n\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to personal information collected about individuals in the United States. If you are located in another country, please review the Ford privacy policy that applies for your country.\n\n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n \n\nCategories and Sources of Personal Information We Collect\nCookies and Similar Technologies\nOur Use of Personal Information\nOur Sharing of Personal Information\nOther Sites and Services\nChoice and Control of Personal Information\nConnected Vehicle Privacy\nCalifornia Privacy Rights and Information\nEuropean Data Protection Rights\nRetention of Personal Information\nLocation of Personal Information\nSecurity of Personal Information\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\nHow to Contact Us\n\n \n\nCATEGORIES AND SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT\n\nThe personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Products you use, and the choices you make. We collect personal information about you in different ways and from different sources, including through the products, services, and features we provide (“Products”), such as websites, mobile applications, online services, technology platforms, and devices we own or operate, as well as the vehicles we manufacture. Details about our privacy practices relating to Ford and Lincoln vehicles appear in the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below.\n\n \n\nInformation You Provide to Us. You share information with us in various ways, including when you create or modify an account with us, use our Products, make a purchase from us, ask us for information about our Products, sign up for an event, enter a contest or sweepstakes, contact the Customer Relationship Center, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we collect the following:\n\nContact Information: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we collect personal or business information such as name, email address, postal address, and phone number. We may also ask you to provide email addresses of others, for example if you use a “tell-a-friend” tool.\nDemographics: When you create or modify an account, you may also provide additional information such as your age range, nationality, and gender.\nPayment Data: If you make a purchase, we collect credit card numbers and other payment or billing information.\nPreferences: You may indicate preferences such as your preferred communication method, language, time zone, and dealer. When you use the vehicle shopping tools on our website, you indicate through your browsing and searches the kinds of vehicles, features, and options you may be interested in.\nAudio/Visual: In some cases, you can upload a photo for a profile image when creating an account, or you may provide your photo at an event or as part of a contest or sweepstakes.\nIdentifiers: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, you may provide us with unique identifiers associated with you. For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.\nSecurity: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one user name and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.\nContent of Communications: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.\nVehicle Service History: We collect vehicle service history from you when you share it with us on our sites.\n\n \n\nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n \n\nInformation From Your Vehicle. Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.\n\n \n\nIf your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:\n\n \n\nVehicle Data\nDriving Data\nVehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)\nAudio/Visual\nMedia Analytics\nVehicle Analytics\n\n \n\nWhich categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below for details and data category definitions.\n\n \n\nIn limited situations, we may collect Vehicle Location, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the section “Our Sharing of Personal Information” below.\n\n \n\nInformation From Your Devices. When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:\n\nDevice Details and Network Information: Some devices share, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the Cookies section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.\nDigital Activity: As described more in the Cookies section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.\nDevice and Mobile Location: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.\n\n \n\nYou may use app or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain Products or features, those Products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n \n\nInformation We Generate About You. We generate information from the data we collect. For example:\n\nDigital Activity: When you build or search for vehicles on our website, we generate results that fit your criteria and allow you to save results so that they are available to you in future visits. When you browse our website or use our other online Products, we may infer your zip code, city, state, and/or country location based on your IP address.\nInferred Preferences: We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics. For example, we may use information about your vehicle and past purchases to determine your likely readiness to make a new purchase, which we may use for marketing, advertising, or other purposes. We may also infer information from your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as webpages visited, vehicles viewed, app features used, etc.\nIdentifiers: When you interact with us, we may generate unique identifiers associated with you or your devices such as Ford account ID, customer ID, rewards program number, or browser or other online identifiers. These unique identifiers help us identify you or associate you with information about you. For example, in our exhibits at auto shows or other events, we may generate a bar code for each visitor that you can swipe as you interact with the exhibit. It may also allow you to access and share photos and videos if you use available technology to take your picture and/or video at the event.\nPayment Data: We may generate information when you pay for products and services, e.g., transaction history.\n\n \n\n \n\nInformation From Other Sources. We obtain information from others when you direct them to share information with us and also from the following sources:\n\nAffiliates: We receive personal information from other companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. Information is shared within this “family” as a normal part of business operations, offering products and services to our customers, and allowing our customers to use their Ford account across multiple Ford experiences (if supported).\nDealers and Other Repairers: We receive data in connection with vehicle sales and service. For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Ford or Lincoln dealer, the dealer shares Contact Information with Ford, including your name and address, as well as VIN and purchase information such as purchase date. We also receive Vehicle Service History information (and certain other vehicle repair information), which includes history of repairs and may include such information as visit details, service details, repair history, applicable recall repairs, repair order details and payment, and warranty and extended service plan information. We may receive vehicle diagnostic information from dealers or other repairers when your vehicle is serviced or repaired using diagnostic scan tools connected to your vehicle.\nService Providers and Suppliers: We may receive Contact Information or other personal information from our vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy.\nBusiness Partners: We receive personal information from other companies we work together with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:\nAdvertising and Analytics Companies: Please see the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy for a description of how we receive information from advertising and analytics providers.\nJoint Marketing Partners: We may receive personal information from partners with which we offer co-branded service or engage in joint marketing activities.\n Third Party Sign-On Integrations: If you sign into one of our Products using a third party’s sign-on integration tool (such as Facebook, Google, or Apple), you allow us to access information about you that the third party makes available through its sign-on integration tool based on its rules or the settings you establish with the third party (e.g., name, user ID, profile picture). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the third parties whose sign-on integration tools you use.\nLaw enforcement agencies, courts, regulatory agencies, and others: We may receive personal information from government agencies or courts for legal compliance purposes, to protect your personal safety or the safety of others, to protect Ford’s or others’ rights or property, or to investigate fraud. We may also receive personal information from others; for example, in connection with litigation settlements, we may acquire information about you from third parties for the purpose of meeting our tax reporting obligations.\nConsumer Data Analytics Firms: We receive Demographics and other data from third parties for purposes such as supporting our marketing campaigns and personalizing Products to our customers.\nParties to Corporate Transactions: We may receive personal information as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of business or assets.\nPublicly-Available Sources: We may obtain Demographics and other data from publicly-available sources, such as open government databases or other data in the public domain, as well as information that is publicly available online on social media, networking, and other sites.\n\n \n\nWe may combine personal information we collect from any of the above sources. We also collect information in de-identified form, such that the information cannot reasonably be linked back to you.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCOOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES\n\n \n\nOur websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.\n\n \n\nCookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign in to your Ford account, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\n \n\nOur websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.\n\n \n\nOur websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party service providers. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.\n\n \n\nFor example, our online Products use third-party analytics tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity. For information about the privacy practices of the listed companies, please review their privacy policies.\n\n \n\n \n\nInterest-Based Advertising\n\nAs noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also share such information we have collected with Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford websites and online services, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) sites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as \"interest-based advertising\" or “online behavioral advertising”.\n\n\n \n\nPages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices in the footer of the page. To see a list of third-party advertising and analytics providers that set cookies from our websites, along with links to manage your preferences, click on the AdChoices link in the footer.\n\n \n\n \n\nIndustry-wide opt-outs. Many of these companies are also members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:\n\nUnited States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance\nCanada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada\nEurope: European Digital Advertising Alliance\n\n \n\nMobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.\n\n \n\nBrowser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n\n \n\nDo Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.\n\n \n\nEmail web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.\n\n \n\nAdobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out here.\n\n \n\n \n\nOUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION \n\n \n\nWe use the personal information we collect for purposes described in this Policy or otherwise disclosed to you.

For example, we use your Ford account identifier (if you were logged in while browsing our website or using our other online Products) or a browser or other unique online identifier (if you were not logged into your account) to link Digital Activity to you over time and across different Products or other digital properties, including those owned or operated by third parties.\n\n \n\nFinally, we may de-identify information we collect about you (including Connected Vehicle Information) and use it for any purpose in accordance with applicable law.\n\n \n\n \n\nOUR SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION\n\n \n\nWe share personal information with your consent, when you direct us to share it with others, as necessary to complete your transactions, or provide the Products you have requested or authorized. For example, when you provide payment data to make a purchase, we will share that data with banks and other entities as necessary for payment processing, fraud prevention, credit risk reduction, or other related financial services. We also share personal information with:\n\n  \n\n\nAffiliates. We share personal information among the companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. We share information within this “family” as a normal part of business operations and offering products and services to our customers:\nFor example, if you are financing your purchase or lease with Ford Credit and Ford Credit asks us to locate your vehicle due to default of your agreement with Ford Credit, we may share Vehicle Location with Ford Credit.\nIf you create a Ford account, we share your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one user name and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).\nDealers.

We share personal information with vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. In such cases we require them to use it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they receive. For example, companies we've hired to provide customer service support or assist in protecting and securing our systems and services may need access to personal information to provide those functions.\n\n\nBusiness Partners.

We share information about factory-installed vehicle features and options with third parties such as auction companies, insurance companies, dealers, lenders, guidebook providers, vehicle websites, and prospective buyers so that they can verify a vehicle’s features and options and estimate its value. The features and options information that we share with these third parties is linked to the unique vehicle identification number (VIN).\n \nLaw Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others. We will share personal information when we believe that doing so is necessary to:\nComply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;\nIn the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;\nDetect, investigate, prevent or otherwise address fraud or privacy issues;\nOperate and maintain the security of our products, including to detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or remediate an attack on our computer systems or networks; or\nProtect the rights or property of ourselves, our affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.\n \nParties to Corporate Transactions.

Based on how the vehicle is equipped, perform a MASTER RESET and complete the appropriate action detailed in number 4 (above). Please read the “How to Tell If a Vehicle Is Sharing Data” section below to learn more. Connected Services such as FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) and Lincoln Connect, if equipped and activated, may send us Connected Vehicle Information and may have associated multiple accounts that may allow the account user to access vehicle location and services, such as remote start, lock and unlock, and information about vehicle status, such as fuel level.\n\n\n Review the terms and conditions and privacy policies for any third-party services or applications to which you subscribe and/or use while in a Ford or Lincoln vehicle.\n\n\nIf you rent a connected vehicle, perform a MASTER RESET before you drive the vehicle and before you return the vehicle to the rental company. Please contact the rental company with any questions.\n\n \n\n \n\nMASTER RESET\n\nPerforming a Master Reset returns the vehicle’s modem to the factory settings and removes any imported personal data like cellular phone contact lists, names of paired devices and/or connected networks. Master Reset also disconnects modem-equipped vehicles from any FordPass / Lincoln Way accounts. See 4 above. Deleting the FordPass/Lincoln Way app from your device will not disable data sharing.\n\n \n\nPERFORM A MASTER RESET:\n\nBEFORE SELLING OR TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP\n\nAFTER PURCHASING OR LEASING A PRE-OWNED VEHICLE\n\nBEFORE AND AFTER RENTING A VEHICLE FROM A RENTAL COMPANY \n\n \n\nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not associating a VIN to a FordPass/Lincoln Way account). But, if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain products or features, those products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n\n \n\nConnected Vehicle Services and Technologies\n\nWe work with AT&T as our current cellular network provider for our Connected Services in the United States.\n\n \n\nOur Connected Services include:\n\nFordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect (if equipped): FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect enables access to features through a modem built into the vehicle. The modem allows the vehicle to connect to wireless networks, much like a mobile device with a subscriber identity module (SIM). Like other vehicle parts, the modem is installed at the factory.\nPeriodically, the modem sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider to enable Connected Services. The messages could include information that identifies the vehicle, the SIM, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect modem. At delivery, select model year 2020 and later vehicles are sharing Vehicle Data with us (e.g., diagnostics).\nThe cellular network provider may also associate the modem’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the modem is deactivated, the modem will communicate with the cellular network provider.\nYou may be able to customize your preferences in the in-vehicle connectivity settings menu. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information. When connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features.\n\n \n\nFord Connectivity Devices (if equipped):\nConnectivity Devices (either installed in the vehicle at the factory, installed in the vehicle by a dealer, or plugged into the OBD port in compatible vehicles) enable access to Connectivity Services. Connectivity Devices allow connected vehicles to connect to a wireless network (much like a mobile device with a SIM).\nPeriodically, the Connectivity Device sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider. These messages contain a unique number which identifies the Connectivity Device’s SIM, the vehicle's VIN, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the Connectivity Device.\nThe cellular network provider may also associate the Connectivity Device’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the Connectivity Device is deactivated, the Connectivity Device will communicate with the cellular network provider. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information.\nWhen connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features. Some features require an active FordPass / Lincoln Way account.\n\n \n\nWi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped): Certain vehicles equipped with FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect can sign-up with AT&T for Wi-Fi Hotspot service in the vehicle. To enable the activation of the Wi-Fi Hotspot, certain information, including the vehicle's VIN and the SIM identifier, is provided to AT&T, who manages the subscription and will use that information according to its own privacy policy, which you can find here. AT&T will inform us when certain data usage thresholds are met. If you have paired FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect to the FordPass or Lincoln Way app, you can view approximate data plan usage amounts within the app and in your vehicle. For more information about the vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot, please visit the following websites:\nFord Vehicles\nLincoln Vehicles\n\nNote: If you’re planning to sell your Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, remember to remove the vehicle from your AT&T account before you sell the vehicle. And, if you purchase or lease a used Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, you’ll need to contact AT&T to add the new vehicle to your AT&T account.\n\n \n\nSYNC Wi-Fi (if equipped): To enhance the SYNC experience, when connected to Wi-Fi (data charges may apply), Vehicle Analytics is shared with us and we periodically release software updates so the vehicle has the latest compatible SYNC version. You can choose to enable Share Media Analytics, Send Failed Voice Commands, and/or Submit Feedback regarding SYNC in the in-vehicle settings menu. \n\nNote: Please make sure you connect the vehicle to trusted Wi-Fi networks\n\n \n\nAppLink (if equipped): You may be able to use AppLink, to connect your mobile apps with SYNC 3/SYNC 4 (SYNC). Your mobile device provides the data connection (so data charges may apply) and SYNC provides the infotainment integration, including voice controls.\nTo enable mobile apps, SYNC requires user consent to send and receive app authorization information and updates, using the data plan associated with the connected device. The connected device sends encrypted data (such as the VIN, SYNC module serial number or other component identifier, odometer, enabled apps, usage statistics and debugging information) to us. SYNC organizes app permissions into groups. When not driving, you may be able to use the settings menu to grant these group permissions individually, change a permission group status, and see the data included in each group, if equipped. When you launch an app using SYNC, the system may ask you to grant certain permissions, for example, information about the vehicle, such as Vehicle Data, Driving Data, Vehicle Location, Convenience Controls, and/or Push Notifications. Please be aware that the permission selections available to you may vary based on which version of SYNC is equipped in your vehicle. You can enable all groups or none of them during the initial app permissions prompts. Please see the owner’s manual for more information. Please note that you are only prompted to grant permissions the first time you use an app with SYNC. We recommend you review the terms and conditions and privacy policies for any third-party app or service to which you subscribe and/or use. We take no responsibility for apps or services provided by any third party, including their use of any data. If you choose to share information about your vehicle through your use of third-party apps or services, once you have shared the information, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policies (and not this Privacy Policy) apply to the shared information.\nIf you change your mind about sharing vehicle information with a mobile app or want to stop using it with SYNC, you can change your preferences in SYNC’s Mobile App settings in the vehicle.\n \n911 Assist (if equipped): 911 Assist (if equipped and active) may, through any paired and connected cellular phone, disclose to emergency services that the vehicle has been in a crash involving the deployment of an airbag or, in certain vehicles, the activation of the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or updates to 911 Assist may also be capable of being used to electronically or verbally provide the vehicle location (such as latitude and longitude) and/or other details about the vehicle or crash, change in velocity, and possible detection of fastened seatbelts, or personal information about the occupants to 911 operators to assist them in providing the most appropriate emergency services. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not activate the 911 Assist feature. If any user sets 911 Assist to on or off, that setting applies for all paired phones. To switch 911 Assist on and off or for more information, please see your owner’s manual (SYNC and Settings).\nNote: Vehicles equipped with the MyKey feature may be capable of overriding the 911 Assist settings and turning 911 Assist On, even if it was previously set to Off. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not enable MyKey.\n \nLocation and Global Positioning System (GPS) (if equipped): Some vehicles contain global positioning system (GPS) capability or, in some instances, may utilize the GPS in connected wireless devices. GPS may be used to determine the vehicle’s physical location, travel direction, and speed, and to record this information over time to provide location-based services.\nFord Apps: If a vehicle is equipped with connectivity technology, you may be able to connect to the vehicle using the FordPass/Lincoln Way apps, or the MyFord Mobile app. If you associate a vehicle to your FordPass/Lincoln Way or MyFord Mobile account, the vehicle may send Connected Vehicle Information, including location information, to us. To turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass/Lincoln Way account, you must perform a MASTER RESET on the vehicle or remove the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. Deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. For more information, please see the app privacy policy:\nFord Pass\nLincoln Way\nMyFordMobile\n\n \n\n \n\nHow to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data\n\n \n\nSelect model year vehicles include in-vehicle icons that indicate when Connected Vehicle Information is being shared:\n\n \n\n \n\nConnected Vehicle Information Transmitted by the Vehicle\n\n \n\nIf a FordPass / LincolnWay account has not been associated with the vehicle, this icon indicates that only Vehicle Data is being shared.\n\nIf a FordPass / LincolnWay account has been associated with the vehicle, this icon indicates that Vehicle Data and/or Driving Data are being shared (based on your sharing settings).\n\n \n\n \n\nThese icons may be hidden temporarily while you navigate in menus or use certain features and services (such as Android Auto™ or Apple CarPlay®).\n\n \n\nYou may be able to check the status bar on the screen of the in-vehicle infotainment system, if equipped, for alerts and notifications, including strength of nearby Wi-Fi networks or the strength of the connection coming from your mobile device.\n\n \n\nVehicles equipped with Connectivity Devices include a window etching (or sticker) with an image similar to below, indicating the Connectivity Device may be sharing Connected Vehicle Information, for example vehicle data and location.\n\nNote: To stop the Connectivity Device from sharing this information, see your Connectivity Settings through the FordPass / Lincoln Way app. You may also remove the vehicle from your FordPass / Lincoln Way account.\n\n \n\nFor other vehicle models, please see the owner’s manual, check the in-vehicle settings (if equipped) or contact your dealer for more information about what connectivity equipment is installed in the vehicle, and how to tell if the vehicle is sharing data. You can also find out how to deactivate vehicle connectivity in the owner’s manual.\n\n \n\nSharing a Vehicle or Driving a Shared Vehicle\n\nIf you share a vehicle with others, please tell them about the connectivity and privacy settings for the vehicle. For example, inform passengers within the vehicle and other drivers of the vehicle that Connected Vehicle Information is being shared with us and our service providers. And, let them know where they can find the information needed to connect to the vehicle's Wi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped and activated) and where they can turn off vehicle location and other connected vehicle data sharing settings, if equipped.\n\n \n\nMultiple accounts can be created on the FordPass / Lincoln Way apps, and more than one account can be connected to a single vehicle. If you drive a vehicle with more than one account connected to it, the user(s) of each account will have access to:\n\n \n\nThe vehicle's location;\nServices that allow the vehicle to be remotely started, locked and unlocked; and\nServices that show information about the vehicle's status (for example, its fuel level).\n\n \n\nSimilarly, if you drive a vehicle with the FordPass / Lincoln Way app connected to it, the user(s) of the app will have access to the information and services outlined above.\n\n \n\nIf you want to connect an account on the FordPass / Lincoln Way app to a vehicle that has already been connected to another account, your name and the fact that you have requested this connection will be shared, via the FordPass / Lincoln Way app, with current user(s) who connected to the vehicle before you. The current user or users have the opportunity to allow or refuse your connection to the vehicle.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, you can turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass / Lincoln Way account by performing a MASTER RESET or by removing the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. To learn how to perform a MASTER RESET, please see your owner’s manual. Simply deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. See Connected Vehicle Controls (above) for more information.\n\n \n\nSome vehicles have in-vehicle pop-up notifications to alert drivers and passengers of Connected Vehicle Information sharing settings (see “How to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data” above). Drivers with an unrecognized mobile device may see a pop-up displayed in-vehicle informing them of the current vehicle data and/or location sharing settings. A mobile device is “recognized” if it has been paired with an infotainment system, like SYNC. This way if someone is new to the vehicle, or not driving it enough to pair their mobile device, the system will inform them of the vehicle’s current data and/or location sharing settings.\n\n \n\n \n\nCALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND INFORMATION\n\n \n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\n\nThis section describes the rights that the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives to California residents.\n\nPlease be aware that dealers are separate legal entities from Ford and, under the CCPA, separate businesses from Ford. If you want to exercise your CCPA rights regarding personal information a Ford or Lincoln dealer may have collected about you, you will need to contact the dealer directly about exercising your rights.\n\n \n\nAccess/Right to Know. You have a right to request that we provide you with the following information:\n\nThe categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the last 12 months.\nThe categories of sources from which we collect personal information.\nThe purposes for collecting, using, or selling personal information.\nThe categories of third parties with which we share personal information.\nThe categories of personal information we have disclosed about you for a business purpose. Note that the CCPA defines “business purpose” broadly; and because we use service providers for a number of business purposes that require access to our systems that hold personal information (such as supplying cloud data storage, maintaining the security of our systems, and providing customer support), in the past 12 months we have disclosed for a business purpose data from all of the categories of personal information that we maintain.\nThe categories of personal information we have sold about you for each category of third party to which the personal information was sold. Note that the CCPA defines “sell” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this Policy may be considered a “sale” under that definition. We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.\n\n \n\nIn the past 12 months, we have shared personal information with others for commercial purposes or their independent uses as follows:\n\n    - SIRIUS XM. We share Contact Information from vehicle sales with SIRIUS where the purchaser is eligible for a complimentary satellite radio trial.\n\n    - Advertising and Digital Analytics Companies. We share Device Details and Network information, Digital Activity, Preferences, Demographics, Device and Mobile Location.\n\n    - Joint Marketing Partners and Dealers. We share the following information with partners and dealers for co-branded service offerings or joint marketing activities:\n\nContact Information, Demographics, Preferences, Inferred Preferences, Content of Communications, Vehicle Service History, Vehicle Data, Device Details and Network information, and Digital Activity.\n\n    - Vehicle Verification and Valuation Partners. We share information about factory-installed vehicle features and options with third parties such as auction companies, insurance companies, dealers, lenders, guidebook providers, vehicle websites, and prospective buyers so that they can verify a vehicle’s features and options and estimate its value. The features and options information that we share with these third parties is linked to the unique vehicle identification number (VIN). \n\n \n\n \n\nRight to Delete. You also have a right to request that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions.\n\n \n\nRight to Opt-Out From Sales.

For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.\nSecurity: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one user name and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.\nContent of Communications: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.\nVehicle Service History: We collect vehicle service history from you when you share it with us on our sites.\n\n \n\nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n \n\nInformation From Your Vehicle. Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.\n\n \n\nIf your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:\n\n \n\nVehicle Data\nDriving Data\nVehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)\nAudio/Visual\nMedia Analytics\nVehicle Analytics\n\n \n\nWhich categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the Connected Vehicle Privacy section below for details and data category definitions.\n\n \n\nIn limited situations, we may collect Vehicle Location, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the section “Our Sharing of Personal Information” below.\n\n \n\nInformation From Your Devices. When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:\n\nDevice Details and Network Information: Some devices share, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the Cookies section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.\nDigital Activity: As described more in the Cookies section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.\nDevice and Mobile Location: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.\n\n \n\nYou may use app or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain Products or features, those Products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n \n\nInformation We Generate About You. We generate information from the data we collect. For example:\n\nDigital Activity: When you build or search for vehicles on our website, we generate results that fit your criteria and allow you to save results so that they are available to you in future visits. When you browse our website or use our other online Products, we may infer your zip code, city, state, and/or country location based on your IP address.\nInferred Preferences: We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics. For example, we may use information about your vehicle and past purchases to determine your likely readiness to make a new purchase, which we may use for marketing, advertising, or other purposes. We may also infer information from your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as webpages visited, vehicles viewed, app features used, etc.\nIdentifiers: When you interact with us, we may generate unique identifiers associated with you or your devices such as Ford account ID, customer ID, rewards program number, or browser or other online identifiers. These unique identifiers help us identify you or associate you with information about you. For example, in our exhibits at auto shows or other events, we may generate a bar code for each visitor that you can swipe as you interact with the exhibit. It may also allow you to access and share photos and videos if you use available technology to take your picture and/or video at the event.\nPayment Data: We may generate information when you pay for products and services, e.g., transaction history.\n\n \n\n \n\nInformation From Other Sources. We obtain information from others when you direct them to share information with us and also from the following sources:\n\nAffiliates: We receive personal information from other companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. Information is shared within this “family” as a normal part of business operations, offering products and services to our customers, and allowing our customers to use their Ford account across multiple Ford experiences (if supported).\nDealers and Other Repairers: We receive data in connection with vehicle sales and service. For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Ford or Lincoln dealer, the dealer shares Contact Information with Ford, including your name and address, as well as VIN and purchase information such as purchase date. We also receive Vehicle Service History information (and certain other vehicle repair information), which includes history of repairs and may include such information as visit details, service details, repair history, applicable recall repairs, repair order details and payment, and warranty and extended service plan information. We may receive vehicle diagnostic information from dealers or other repairers when your vehicle is serviced or repaired using diagnostic scan tools connected to your vehicle.\nService Providers and Suppliers: We may receive Contact Information or other personal information from our vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy.\nBusiness Partners: We receive personal information from other companies we work together with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:\nAdvertising and Analytics Companies: Please see the Cookies section of this Privacy Policy for a description of how we receive information from advertising and analytics providers.\nJoint Marketing Partners: We may receive personal information from partners with which we offer co-branded service or engage in joint marketing activities.\n Third Party Sign-On Integrations: If you sign into one of our Products using a third party’s sign-on integration tool (such as Facebook, Google, or Apple), you allow us to access information about you that the third party makes available through its sign-on integration tool based on its rules or the settings you establish with the third party (e.g., name, user ID, profile picture). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of the third parties whose sign-on integration tools you use.\nLaw enforcement agencies, courts, regulatory agencies, and others: We may receive personal information from government agencies or courts for legal compliance purposes, to protect your personal safety or the safety of others, to protect Ford’s or others’ rights or property, or to investigate fraud. We may also receive personal information from others; for example, in connection with litigation settlements, we may acquire information about you from third parties for the purpose of meeting our tax reporting obligations.\nConsumer Data Analytics Firms: We receive Demographics and other data from third parties for purposes such as supporting our marketing campaigns and personalizing Products to our customers.\nParties to Corporate Transactions: We may receive personal information as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of business or assets.\nPublicly-Available Sources: We may obtain Demographics and other data from publicly-available sources, such as open government databases or other data in the public domain, as well as information that is publicly available online on social media, networking, and other sites.\n\n \n\nWe may combine personal information we collect from any of the above sources. We also collect information in de-identified form, such that the information cannot reasonably be linked back to you.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nCOOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES\n\n \n\nOur websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.\n\n \n\nCookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign in to your Ford account, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.\n\n \n\nOur websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.\n\n \n\nOur websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party service providers. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.\n\n \n\nFor example, our online Products use third-party analytics tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity. For information about the privacy practices of the listed companies, please review their privacy policies.\n\n \n\n \n\nInterest-Based Advertising\n\nAs noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also share such information we have collected with Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford websites and online services, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) sites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as \"interest-based advertising\" or “online behavioral advertising”.\n\n\n \n\nPages of our website that collect information that may be used by such advertising partners for interest-based advertising purposes are identified by a link to AdChoices in the footer of the page. To see a list of third-party advertising and analytics providers that set cookies from our websites, along with links to manage your preferences, click on the AdChoices link in the footer.\n\n \n\n \n\nIndustry-wide opt-outs. Many of these companies are also members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:\n\nUnited States: Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance\nCanada: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada\nEurope: European Digital Advertising Alliance\n\n \n\nMobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.\n\n \n\nBrowser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.\n\n \n\nDo Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.\n\n \n\nEmail web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.\n\n \n\nAdobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op controls. Ford participates in the Adobe Experience Cloud Device Co-op. This Co-op allows Adobe to better understand how websites and apps are used by linking various devices that appear to be used by the same person. In turn, it helps companies who are members of the Co-op, including Ford, create websites, apps and ads customized for you, across all your devices. You can learn more about the Co-op, how it works, and how to opt-out here.\n\n \n\n \n\nOUR USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION \n\n \n\nWe use the personal information we collect for purposes described in this Policy or otherwise disclosed to you.

Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. We share information within this “family” as a normal part of business operations and offering products and services to our customers:\nFor example, if you are financing your purchase or lease with Ford Credit and Ford Credit asks us to locate your vehicle due to default of your agreement with Ford Credit, we may share Vehicle Location with Ford Credit.\nIf you create a Ford account, we share your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one user name and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).\nDealers.

We share information about factory-installed vehicle features and options with third parties such as auction companies, insurance companies, dealers, lenders, guidebook providers, vehicle websites, and prospective buyers so that they can verify a vehicle’s features and options and estimate its value. The features and options information that we share with these third parties is linked to the unique vehicle identification number (VIN).\n \nLaw Enforcement Agencies, Courts, Regulatory Agencies, and Others. We will share personal information when we believe that doing so is necessary to:\nComply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;\nIn the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;\nDetect, investigate, prevent or otherwise address fraud or privacy issues;\nOperate and maintain the security of our products, including to detect, investigate, prevent, stop, or remediate an attack on our computer systems or networks; or\nProtect the rights or property of ourselves, our affiliates, or others, including by enforcing our agreements, terms, and policies.\n \nParties to Corporate Transactions.

For information on other situations when we collect Connected Vehicle Information, see the section “Categories and Sources of Personal Information We Collect” above.\n\n \n\nSelect vehicles for model year 2020 and later share Vehicle Data (e.g., diagnostics) with us at delivery and may share other categories of Connected Vehicle Information with us, depending on the connectivity factors described in the preceding paragraph.\n\n \n\nWhen Connected Vehicle Information is collected from the vehicle, it may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.\n\n \n\nWe may also collect Connected Vehicle Information from the vehicle in de-identified form, such that the information cannot reasonably be linked back to you.\n\n \n\n \n\nYour Sharing of Information about Your Vehicle with Third Parties\n\nYou may directly share information about your connected vehicle, or cause information about your connected vehicle to be shared, with third parties when you choose to use their applications or services that:\n\n\n \n\nAre made available to you through the vehicle infotainment system;\nAre made available to you through the third party’s app on your mobile device when you connect your mobile device to the vehicle via Bluetooth or tether; or\nRequire or permit the account you have with the third party to be linked to a Ford or Lincoln vehicle or mobile application.\n\n \n\nIf you choose to share information about your vehicle with third parties, once you have shared it, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policies (and not this Policy) apply to the shared information.\n\n \n\nConnected Vehicle Controls\n\n \n\nAs described below, a variety of technologies work together to provide the ability to access Connected Services and features. Depending on how the vehicle is equipped, different in-vehicle controls may be available to you. Learn more about modems, other connectivity technology, and in-vehicle controls in the owner’s manual or call the Ford Customer Relationship Center (see How to Contact Us below). Owner’s manuals are available at the following links:\n\nFord Vehicles\nLincoln Vehicles\n\n \n\nYou can use these controls and take other steps to protect your privacy with respect to Connected Services. For example, we recommend the following:\n\n \n\nRead your vehicle owner’s manual and familiarize yourself with how the vehicle you are driving (or riding in) is equipped, for example vehicle connectivity options and data sharing settings.\n\n\nRead this Connected Vehicle Privacy section so you are aware of what Connected Vehicle Information may be collected and how it is used.\n\n\nInform passengers and other drivers of the vehicle that Connected Vehicle Information is being collected and used by us and our service providers.\n\n\nPrior to selling or transferring ownership of the vehicle, complete a MASTER RESET (see below) to remove imported personal data like contact lists, names of paired devices and/or connected networks to return the vehicle to the default factory settings and:\n\na. For vehicles with modems: this will also disassociate any FordPass/Lincoln Way account(s) connected to the vehicle and stop any account-related data sharing\nb. For vehicles with a Connectivity Device: you must remove the VIN from your FordPass/Lincoln Way account(s) to disassociate the vehicle from the account and stop any account-related data sharing\n\nNote: Account-related data sharing will continue unless (a) or (b) is performed. Please contact us if you have any questions.\n\n\nIf you purchase or lease a pre-owned Ford or Lincoln vehicle, please check here for Ford vehicles, and here for Lincoln vehicles to see if your vehicle has connectivity technology. Based on how the vehicle is equipped, perform a MASTER RESET and complete the appropriate action detailed in number 4 (above). Please read the “How to Tell If a Vehicle Is Sharing Data” section below to learn more. Connected Services such as FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) and Lincoln Connect, if equipped and activated, may send us Connected Vehicle Information and may have associated multiple accounts that may allow the account user to access vehicle location and services, such as remote start, lock and unlock, and information about vehicle status, such as fuel level.\n\n\n Review the terms and conditions and privacy policies for any third-party services or applications to which you subscribe and/or use while in a Ford or Lincoln vehicle.\n\n\nIf you rent a connected vehicle, perform a MASTER RESET before you drive the vehicle and before you return the vehicle to the rental company. Please contact the rental company with any questions.\n\n \n\n \n\nMASTER RESET\n\nPerforming a Master Reset returns the vehicle’s modem to the factory settings and removes any imported personal data like cellular phone contact lists, names of paired devices and/or connected networks. Master Reset also disconnects modem-equipped vehicles from any FordPass / Lincoln Way accounts. See 4 above. Deleting the FordPass/Lincoln Way app from your device will not disable data sharing.\n\n \n\nPERFORM A MASTER RESET:\n\nBEFORE SELLING OR TRANSFERRING OWNERSHIP\n\nAFTER PURCHASING OR LEASING A PRE-OWNED VEHICLE\n\nBEFORE AND AFTER RENTING A VEHICLE FROM A RENTAL COMPANY \n\n \n\nWhen you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not associating a VIN to a FordPass/Lincoln Way account). But, if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain products or features, those products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.\n\n\n \n\nConnected Vehicle Services and Technologies\n\nWe work with AT&T as our current cellular network provider for our Connected Services in the United States.\n\n \n\nOur Connected Services include:\n\nFordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect (if equipped): FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect enables access to features through a modem built into the vehicle. The modem allows the vehicle to connect to wireless networks, much like a mobile device with a subscriber identity module (SIM). Like other vehicle parts, the modem is installed at the factory.\nPeriodically, the modem sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider to enable Connected Services. The messages could include information that identifies the vehicle, the SIM, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) / Lincoln Connect modem. At delivery, select model year 2020 and later vehicles are sharing Vehicle Data with us (e.g., diagnostics).\nThe cellular network provider may also associate the modem’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the modem is deactivated, the modem will communicate with the cellular network provider.\nYou may be able to customize your preferences in the in-vehicle connectivity settings menu. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information. When connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features.\n\n \n\nFord Connectivity Devices (if equipped):\nConnectivity Devices (either installed in the vehicle at the factory, installed in the vehicle by a dealer, or plugged into the OBD port in compatible vehicles) enable access to Connectivity Services. Connectivity Devices allow connected vehicles to connect to a wireless network (much like a mobile device with a SIM).\nPeriodically, the Connectivity Device sends messages to us, through our cellular network provider. These messages contain a unique number which identifies the Connectivity Device’s SIM, the vehicle's VIN, and the electronic serial number (ESN) of the Connectivity Device.\nThe cellular network provider may also associate the Connectivity Device’s SIM to additional information such as cellular network tower identification. Unless the Connectivity Device is deactivated, the Connectivity Device will communicate with the cellular network provider. Please refer to the owner’s manual or contact the Ford Customer Relationship Center for more information.\nWhen connected with the FordPass app (Lincoln Way app), you may be able to access additional features. Some features require an active FordPass / Lincoln Way account.\n\n \n\nWi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped): Certain vehicles equipped with FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect can sign-up with AT&T for Wi-Fi Hotspot service in the vehicle. To enable the activation of the Wi-Fi Hotspot, certain information, including the vehicle's VIN and the SIM identifier, is provided to AT&T, who manages the subscription and will use that information according to its own privacy policy, which you can find here. AT&T will inform us when certain data usage thresholds are met. If you have paired FordPass Connect (SYNC Connect) or Lincoln Connect to the FordPass or Lincoln Way app, you can view approximate data plan usage amounts within the app and in your vehicle. For more information about the vehicle Wi-Fi hotspot, please visit the following websites:\nFord Vehicles\nLincoln Vehicles\n\nNote: If you’re planning to sell your Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, remember to remove the vehicle from your AT&T account before you sell the vehicle. And, if you purchase or lease a used Ford or Lincoln connected vehicle, you’ll need to contact AT&T to add the new vehicle to your AT&T account.\n\n \n\nSYNC Wi-Fi (if equipped): To enhance the SYNC experience, when connected to Wi-Fi (data charges may apply), Vehicle Analytics is shared with us and we periodically release software updates so the vehicle has the latest compatible SYNC version. You can choose to enable Share Media Analytics, Send Failed Voice Commands, and/or Submit Feedback regarding SYNC in the in-vehicle settings menu. \n\nNote: Please make sure you connect the vehicle to trusted Wi-Fi networks\n\n \n\nAppLink (if equipped): You may be able to use AppLink, to connect your mobile apps with SYNC 3/SYNC 4 (SYNC). Your mobile device provides the data connection (so data charges may apply) and SYNC provides the infotainment integration, including voice controls.\nTo enable mobile apps, SYNC requires user consent to send and receive app authorization information and updates, using the data plan associated with the connected device. The connected device sends encrypted data (such as the VIN, SYNC module serial number or other component identifier, odometer, enabled apps, usage statistics and debugging information) to us. SYNC organizes app permissions into groups. When not driving, you may be able to use the settings menu to grant these group permissions individually, change a permission group status, and see the data included in each group, if equipped. When you launch an app using SYNC, the system may ask you to grant certain permissions, for example, information about the vehicle, such as Vehicle Data, Driving Data, Vehicle Location, Convenience Controls, and/or Push Notifications. Please be aware that the permission selections available to you may vary based on which version of SYNC is equipped in your vehicle. You can enable all groups or none of them during the initial app permissions prompts. Please see the owner’s manual for more information. Please note that you are only prompted to grant permissions the first time you use an app with SYNC. We recommend you review the terms and conditions and privacy policies for any third-party app or service to which you subscribe and/or use. We take no responsibility for apps or services provided by any third party, including their use of any data. If you choose to share information about your vehicle through your use of third-party apps or services, once you have shared the information, the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policies (and not this Privacy Policy) apply to the shared information.\nIf you change your mind about sharing vehicle information with a mobile app or want to stop using it with SYNC, you can change your preferences in SYNC’s Mobile App settings in the vehicle.\n \n911 Assist (if equipped): 911 Assist (if equipped and active) may, through any paired and connected cellular phone, disclose to emergency services that the vehicle has been in a crash involving the deployment of an airbag or, in certain vehicles, the activation of the fuel pump shut-off. Certain versions or updates to 911 Assist may also be capable of being used to electronically or verbally provide the vehicle location (such as latitude and longitude) and/or other details about the vehicle or crash, change in velocity, and possible detection of fastened seatbelts, or personal information about the occupants to 911 operators to assist them in providing the most appropriate emergency services. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not activate the 911 Assist feature. If any user sets 911 Assist to on or off, that setting applies for all paired phones. To switch 911 Assist on and off or for more information, please see your owner’s manual (SYNC and Settings).\nNote: Vehicles equipped with the MyKey feature may be capable of overriding the 911 Assist settings and turning 911 Assist On, even if it was previously set to Off. If you do not want to disclose this information, do not enable MyKey.\n \nLocation and Global Positioning System (GPS) (if equipped): Some vehicles contain global positioning system (GPS) capability or, in some instances, may utilize the GPS in connected wireless devices. GPS may be used to determine the vehicle’s physical location, travel direction, and speed, and to record this information over time to provide location-based services.\nFord Apps: If a vehicle is equipped with connectivity technology, you may be able to connect to the vehicle using the FordPass/Lincoln Way apps, or the MyFord Mobile app. If you associate a vehicle to your FordPass/Lincoln Way or MyFord Mobile account, the vehicle may send Connected Vehicle Information, including location information, to us. To turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass/Lincoln Way account, you must perform a MASTER RESET on the vehicle or remove the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. Deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. For more information, please see the app privacy policy:\nFord Pass\nLincoln Way\nMyFordMobile\n\n \n\n \n\nHow to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data\n\n \n\nSelect model year vehicles include in-vehicle icons that indicate when Connected Vehicle Information is being shared:\n\n \n\n \n\nConnected Vehicle Information Transmitted by the Vehicle\n\n \n\nIf a FordPass / LincolnWay account has not been associated with the vehicle, this icon indicates that only Vehicle Data is being shared.\n\nIf a FordPass / LincolnWay account has been associated with the vehicle, this icon indicates that Vehicle Data and/or Driving Data are being shared (based on your sharing settings).\n\n \n\n \n\nThese icons may be hidden temporarily while you navigate in menus or use certain features and services (such as Android Auto™ or Apple CarPlay®).\n\n \n\nYou may be able to check the status bar on the screen of the in-vehicle infotainment system, if equipped, for alerts and notifications, including strength of nearby Wi-Fi networks or the strength of the connection coming from your mobile device.\n\n \n\nVehicles equipped with Connectivity Devices include a window etching (or sticker) with an image similar to below, indicating the Connectivity Device may be sharing Connected Vehicle Information, for example vehicle data and location.\n\nNote: To stop the Connectivity Device from sharing this information, see your Connectivity Settings through the FordPass / Lincoln Way app. You may also remove the vehicle from your FordPass / Lincoln Way account.\n\n \n\nFor other vehicle models, please see the owner’s manual, check the in-vehicle settings (if equipped) or contact your dealer for more information about what connectivity equipment is installed in the vehicle, and how to tell if the vehicle is sharing data. You can also find out how to deactivate vehicle connectivity in the owner’s manual.\n\n \n\nSharing a Vehicle or Driving a Shared Vehicle\n\nIf you share a vehicle with others, please tell them about the connectivity and privacy settings for the vehicle. For example, inform passengers within the vehicle and other drivers of the vehicle that Connected Vehicle Information is being shared with us and our service providers. And, let them know where they can find the information needed to connect to the vehicle's Wi-Fi Hotspot (if equipped and activated) and where they can turn off vehicle location and other connected vehicle data sharing settings, if equipped.\n\n \n\nMultiple accounts can be created on the FordPass / Lincoln Way apps, and more than one account can be connected to a single vehicle. If you drive a vehicle with more than one account connected to it, the user(s) of each account will have access to:\n\n \n\nThe vehicle's location;\nServices that allow the vehicle to be remotely started, locked and unlocked; and\nServices that show information about the vehicle's status (for example, its fuel level).\n\n \n\nSimilarly, if you drive a vehicle with the FordPass / Lincoln Way app connected to it, the user(s) of the app will have access to the information and services outlined above.\n\n \n\nIf you want to connect an account on the FordPass / Lincoln Way app to a vehicle that has already been connected to another account, your name and the fact that you have requested this connection will be shared, via the FordPass / Lincoln Way app, with current user(s) who connected to the vehicle before you. The current user or users have the opportunity to allow or refuse your connection to the vehicle.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, you can turn off sharing data associated with your FordPass / Lincoln Way account by performing a MASTER RESET or by removing the VIN from your FordPass / Lincoln Way app garage. To learn how to perform a MASTER RESET, please see your owner’s manual. Simply deleting the app from your device will not disable data sharing. See Connected Vehicle Controls (above) for more information.\n\n \n\nSome vehicles have in-vehicle pop-up notifications to alert drivers and passengers of Connected Vehicle Information sharing settings (see “How to Know if a Vehicle is Sharing Data” above). Drivers with an unrecognized mobile device may see a pop-up displayed in-vehicle informing them of the current vehicle data and/or location sharing settings. A mobile device is “recognized” if it has been paired with an infotainment system, like SYNC. This way if someone is new to the vehicle, or not driving it enough to pair their mobile device, the system will inform them of the vehicle’s current data and/or location sharing settings.\n\n \n\n \n\nCALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS AND INFORMATION\n\n \n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act\n\nThis section describes the rights that the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives to California residents.\n\nPlease be aware that dealers are separate legal entities from Ford and, under the CCPA, separate businesses from Ford.

Continued scanning maintains an evergreen inventory of tracking technologies and up-to-date policies across your web properties.\n\nAutomatically Categorize Cookies and Trackers\n\nLeverage the world’s largest database of over 30 million pre-categorized cookies to group trackers by purpose.

Enabling geolocation rules will automatically display different banners and consent models based on region, country, or state.\n\nEnable Cookie Auto-Blocking to Ensure Compliance\n\nUse no-code cookie blocking to automatically block trackers from deploying until explicit consent is gained. Enable support for industry frameworks and vendor-specific opt-outs to send appropriate consent signals for AdTech use cases. Leverage optional traditional blocking methods like tag manager integration and script re-writing.\n\nAutomate Scanning and Maintain Records\n\nSchedule regular scans of your website and auto-populate your updated cookie list into your cookie policy after each scan.

EFFICIENT. ELECTRIC.\n\nThe best-selling commercial van brand in the U.S. * is helping lead business into the future. Introducing the all-new, U.S.-assembled Ford E-Transit van. ** The only electric work van that has the backing of the Ford Motor Company. That means an entire ecosystem of products, software and charging solutions that will allow you to smoothly transition to the future of business.\nComputer-generated image shown. Available early 2022.\n*Based on the total U.S. reported sales (1979-2019CY). Includes Ford E-Series, formerly called Econoline, Van and Chassis, Club Wagon; Transit Connect Cargo Van and Passenger Wagon; Transit Cargo Van, Passenger Van and Chassis.\n**Assembled in the USA with domestic and foreign parts.\n\n \n\nTAILORED RANGE\n\nBy leveraging more than 30 million miles of Ford Pro™ Telematics* data, we learned that the average daily range from commercial vans in the U.S. is 74 miles. Of course, we also understand that there are days when those distances are higher and recognize the need to adjust for factors such as cold weather. We consequently designed E-Transit with a targeted 126 miles of range (Cargo Van low-roof models). **\n* Available on vehicles with embedded modem or equipped with approved plug‐in device (PID). May require modem activation. Ford Pro Telematics and Ford Data Services require a purchased subscription. Terms and conditions apply. Telematics service and features, and access to vehicle data, depend on subscription and compatible AT&T network availability. Evolving technology/cellular networks/vehicle capability may limit functionality and prevent operation of connected features.\n**Based on a full charge. USA targeted range reflecting current capability based on analytical projection consistent with US EPA MCT drive cycle methodology (www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/EPAtestprocedureforEVs-PHEVs-11-14-2017.pdf ). Actual range varies with conditions such as external elements, driving behaviors, vehicle maintenance and lithium-ion battery age.

Ava\n\nSlide 1 of 2\nCOST OF OWNERSHIP\nDid you know that purchasing an all-electric vehicle may qualify you for a federal tax incentive.* And since an all-electric vehicle requires no gas, it may potentially lower scheduled maintenance costs. In fact, scheduled maintenance costs for the All-Electric E-Transit model are estimated to be 40 percent less than the average scheduled maintenance costs for a gas-powered 2020 Transit over 8 years/100,000 miles (whichever comes first). **\n\n\nComputer-generated image shown. Available early 2022.\n*Please consult your tax professional to determine eligibility and amount of your incentive. The federal tax credit is a potential future tax savings. The amount of your tax savings will depend on your individual tax circumstances. Tax incentives are not within Ford’s control and this information does not constitute tax advice. https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409.\n**Scheduled maintenance costs based on recommended service schedule as published in the Owner’s Manual. Analysis reflects Ford Motor Company’s standard method for calculating scheduled maintenance cost, and reflects data available in 2019 & 2020.\nPRO POWER ONBOARD\nAvailable Pro Power OnBoard* provides 2.4 kW of power. Enough to charge the tools you need to get the job done, from power tools like saws, drills, jackhammers and more to tablets, laptops and label scanners, which eliminates the need for a generator. And since it works while the van is being driven, it’s easier to keep things powered between jobs.\nComputer-generated image shown. Available early 2022.\n*See Owner’s Manual for important operating instructions.\nBUILT WITHOUT COMPROMISE\nThe E-Transit van does everything except compromise. For instance, by placing the battery underneath the body of the vehicle, you get the benefits of an electric powertrain without using up cargo space. And with a maximum payload of 3,800lbs. on cargo van low roof, regular wheelbase or 4,290 lbs. on cutaway,* you can feel comfortable using every inch of that space to bring what you need to get the job done.\n \nAftermarket equipment shown.

By redesigning the center console there is even more leg room, and improved interior walk-through. The new rotary shifter replaces the manual parking brake lever with an e-brake on the instrument panel. While the standard overhead rear shelf delete can give you even more head room when moving around the vehicle. The result is greater functionality and productivity.\n \nComputer-generated image and simulated screen shown.

For more information, visit IRS.gov and contact your tax professional.\n*Under Bonus Depreciation in Section 168(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, companies may be eligible to fully expense the cost of trucks, vans and SUVs rated over 6,000 lbs. GVWR, when purchased for business use. Trucks and vans that are considered passenger vehicles, rated under 6,000 lbs. GVWR, are limited to $18,100 of depreciation in the year of purchase with normal MACRS depreciation on the remaining basis in the vehicle in subsequent years. A vehicle is not considered a passenger vehicle, and is thus not limited to the lower depreciation amounts, if it is considered a “qualified non-personal use vehicle.” Qualified non-personal use vehicles are vehicles that, by virtue of their nature or design, are not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal purposes. Examples of qualified non-personal use vehicles include 1) a vehicle that can seat nine-plus passengers behind the driver’s seat, 2) a heavy non-SUV vehicle with a cargo area of at least six feet in interior length or 3) a vehicle with a fully enclosed driver’s compartment/cargo area, no seating behind the driver’s seat, and no body section protruding more than 30 inches ahead of the leading edge of the windshield.
